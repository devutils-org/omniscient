# Open findings

Cross-cutting findings from the family threads, kept here because the notes they
came from were untracked and are gone. Each one is reproducible, names who it
belongs to, and is not a task list: several need a decision before they need
code.

## 1. The catalog declares per entry what actually varies per backend

Three threads hit this from three directions in one session, which is usually
the sign of a real modelling gap rather than three inconveniences.

**Targets.** `catalog::Backend` carries `id`, `requires`, `cost`, `degraded`,
`equivalent` and `join` — and nothing about which targets it can serve. The
resolver only knows the entry-level `targets` map. So `io.bytes --system`, whose
chain is `bpf:tp` → `fs:cgroup` → `fs:proc`, resolves onto `fs:cgroup`, a
backend whose whole purpose is per-cgroup attribution. Reordering the chain
would fix that request and break the opposite one: `--cgroup` would land on
`/proc/diskstats` and be answered with the whole machine's I/O, which is the
worst bug this tool can have.

**Filter fields.** Of the 42 sources with a collector, 26 declare a
`filter_fields` entry that no collector in that family emits. Since the
userspace filter now actually runs, a predicate over such a field is false
everywhere and empties the series. The run says so — "no event carried `cpu`,
so that part of the predicate was never true" — but the catalog is promising
something the build does not deliver.

| Family | Sources | Field(s) never emitted |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu` | cycles, instructions, ipc, branch_misses, cache_misses, context_switches, migrations | `comm` |
| `mem` | rss, pss, uss, faults, heap.alloc | `comm` |
| `io` | bytes, iops, merges, inflight | `dev`, `rwbs`, `comm` |
| `net` | bytes | `comm` |
| `sched` | wakeup, switches | `pid` |
| `power` | freq, cstate, throttle | `cpu` |
| `proc` | fd, threads | `comm` (fixed: both now emit it) |
| `runtime` | jit | `comm` |

Some of these are per-backend too: `comm` on `net.bytes` is real for the eBPF
backend and impossible for `/proc/net/dev`, which has no idea which process
moved what.

**What to do.** Either give `Backend` its own `targets` and `filter_fields`,
falling back to the entry's when absent, or accept that an entry describes the
union and make the resolver and the validator say which backend drops what.
The first is more honest and more work. Until then, per source, the choice is to
emit the attribute or take the field out of the catalog — and guessing which the
author meant is not something to do for them.

`src/collect/gpu/device.rs` has the test shape worth copying:
`every_filter_field_the_catalog_offers_is_on_the_events` reads the catalog
entry, samples once, and asserts each declared field is on the event. Twelve
lines, and it catches every row of that table.

---

## 2. There is no key for a device or a cpu

`KeyValue` gained `Iface` for `net`. Nothing exists for a block device or a cpu,
and `emit::grouped` keys a series on the event's first key.

So the four `io` diskstats sources emit one event per tick holding the sum over
every leaf device, with a `devices` attribute naming what was summed. The sum is
correct — leaf devices do not overlap — but a machine with an NVMe and a
spinning disk reports one number for both, and the `topk` over devices that
`io.bytes` and `io.iops` declare cannot be expressed at all. `power` has the
same gap per cpu: `--cpu` narrows the reading, but a per-cpu series is
impossible, which is why frequency reports a mean with `min_hz`/`max_hz` beside
it. `cpu.util` refuses `--cpu` for the same reason rather than answering with
the machine's average.

Wanted, in the shape `Iface` already has:

```rust
KeyValue::Dev { major: u32, minor: u32 }   // dev:259+0
KeyValue::Cpu { cpu: u32 }                 // cpu:7
```

The `dev` filter field four `io` entries already declare would then have
something to match against.

## 3. A skipping test is not a passing test

This cost three threads time in one session, in three different shapes, and it
is the most transferable lesson of the lot.

- A `cpu` test asked for `--emit raw` on a source that did not declare `raw`,
  and skipped whenever the command failed on the assumption that a failure means
  a machine that cannot count. The request had been **refused** since the test
  was written: it passed, in green, for hours, checking nothing.
- Two `power` tests skipped any source `omn list` did not call "usable", and
  `power.temp` reports as *assumed rather than checked*. They passed without
  running.
- An `io` ground-truth test needed a real block device and used `stat` to find
  one; btrfs gives its subvolumes an anonymous `st_dev` that appears nowhere
  under `/sys/dev/block`, so it silently skipped on the only machine that could
  run it.

A machine that cannot serve a request and a request that cannot mean anything
are different answers, and only the first is a reason to stop quietly.
`tests/family_cpu.rs` has the discriminator:

```rust
fn machine_cannot_serve(message: &str) -> bool {
    message.contains("no viable backend")
        || message.contains("cannot start collecting")
        || message.contains("perf_event_paranoid")
}
```

Anything that can skip should be able to say, in its message, what it would have
checked.

## 4. Losses that are not counted as losses

**A throttled perf event.** `PERF_RECORD_THROTTLE` is decoded by `SampledEvent`
and ignored by `src/collect/mem/page_faults.rs`, so a throttled run looks
complete. `sched.switches` counts it into `Losses::dropped` with a reason naming
`kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate`. The shared layer should expose
`SampledEvent::throttled()`, and `Losses` should carry a `throttled` count of
its own: the number of events lost inside a throttled period is not known, and
folding it into `dropped` overstates precision.

**The closing read of a polled counter.** `net/dev.rs::stop` takes a final
reading, on the grounds that without one the last interval of every run is
dropped. `io` and `power` deliberately do not, because `run_all` samples every
collector and *then* decides whether to stop, so a closing read covers only the
few microseconds since the last tick — in `io` it produced a second point at the
same offset with a value of zero, dragging every summary after it. Both cannot
be right. Either the runner stops before its last sample rather than after it,
or no counter collector reads at the edge. Today a reader comparing two families
gets a different convention in each.

---

## 5. Smaller, each with its reason

- **An exit code for "valid, but this mechanism is not built".** A mode a
  collector cannot serve returns `CollectError::Start` and exits 1, like a real
  failure. `NoCollector` exits 3 and this belongs in the same class.
- **`count` → `raw` in the mode × emit matrix.** Added by the `cpu` thread so a
  counted source's own attributes — the terms of `cpu.ipc`, the `enabled_ns` and
  `running_ns` every counter reports — can reach a user. A counted window *is*
  one event, so `raw` is the emit that shows it. It is a model decision
  documented only in `docs/families/cpu.md`: promote it here or revert it.
- **A rate over the counter's own window.** `emit::rate` divides by wall clock;
  a counted source knows exactly how long it was enabled and puts it on the
  event as `enabled_ns`.
- **`Unit::Watts` does not exist**, which is part of why `gpu.power` reports the
  energy counter rather than an instantaneous draw.
- **The GPU is not in the environment capture**, and two runs are comparable
  only if they were taken on the same device under the same driver. Not free:
  `nvmlInit` costs 3.3–4.9 ms and `Capabilities::detect` runs on every command,
  including those that measure nothing.
- **`hwmon` is answerable and still unverified.** `Capabilities::probe` ends
  with a family extension point; `power` can answer it by listing
  `/sys/class/hwmon` for a chip with a `tempN_input`. (`pmu:power/energy-pkg/`
  was the other half of this and is done: the encoding is read from sysfs and
  the domain is opened, so `power.energy` collects through perf without root.)

## 6. Measurements not worth deriving again

From the threads that made them, on the development machine.

- **Memory the allocator already holds is already resident and faults nothing.**
  Three identical `Vec` allocations gave 64, 64, then **0** faults. Any test
  whose premise is "touching memory faults" must `mmap(MAP_ANONYMOUS)` its
  pages. This, not huge pages and not loss, is what made the fault sampler look
  flaky.
- **A fault is not a page.** With multi-size THP one fault installs a folio, so
  the count is a fraction of the pages touched: 263 faults for 1 MiB, 528 for
  32 MiB, from 3.9 KiB per fault up to 62 KiB.
- **A waker can be the task that was merely interrupted.** A process doing
  nothing but `sleep 0.3` appeared to wake `rcu_preempt`, a kworker and a
  network daemon: softirqs run in the interrupted task's context, and a waker of
  pid 0 is the idle task. Any `WAKEUP` join is only as good as the waker.
- **Per-process VRAM from NVML is exact** — 256 MiB allocated through the CUDA
  driver API came back as 268435456 bytes — but an empty CUDA context already
  holds 163.6 MB. VRAM held is an arena, not usage.
- **Integrating NVML's sampled power does not reproduce the device's energy
  counter**, and polling faster makes it worse: ratio 0.90–0.97 at 1 Hz,
  0.64–0.75 at 20 Hz. The driver returns an already-filtered value.
- **RAPL reads fine through perf as an ordinary user here** where sysfs will not
  show it without root: type 14, config `0x02`, `pid = -1`, cpu 0, two reads a
  second apart gave 145.5 W of package power.
- **A preload shim costs 132 ns per call against 740 ns for an eBPF uprobe** on
  the same event, and the uprobe needs privileges CI runners do not grant.
- **`power.cstate` can report an idle share above 1.0 for one tick.** The kernel
  credits residency when a cpu *leaves* an idle state, so a tick in which a long
  sleep ended is paid time belonging to earlier ticks. Over two seconds it reads
  0.968 against `/proc/stat`'s independent 0.974. Reported as it is, because
  clamping it would hide the effect and break the sum.

## 7. What the join engine found outside itself

From the thread that implemented `eq`, `scoped_eq` and `wakeup`.

- **`--pid a,b` measures only `a`.** `Target::Pid` holds a list and every
  collector reads it through `Target::first_pid`, which returns the first and
  drops the rest silently: eleven call sites, every family. A run asking for two
  processes reports one, with no note anywhere that the second was ignored — and
  a join across two tasks, which is the case that distinguishes a correlator
  from a counter, cannot be set up through one session at all. Either the
  request refuses more than one pid until the collectors follow them, or
  `attach` takes the list. The join engine's own two-task ground truth had to
  run the tool four times and merge the streams to get around it.

- **A state that opened and was never ended was losing its attributions.**
  Found while generalizing, and it predates the generalization: opening a state
  on an identity that already had one overwrote it, so `opened` counted it and
  nothing else did. The engine now ends the state being replaced and counts it
  in `StateStats::replaced`, and `opened` now equals
  `closed + expired + overflowed + still_open` — an invariant the suite asserts
  on every correlation it builds.

- **`scoped_eq` has no producer yet.** Only `blk:rq@open_ts` carries a scope,
  and no collector emits a `Blk` key, so the match is exercised against
  constructed streams and the recycling it exists to prevent is demonstrated
  rather than observed. When stream E's kprobes land on the block layer, the
  first `io.latency` run is also the first real test of it: a completion whose
  `open_ts` does not match the open request must be counted, not attributed.

- **`examples/sched-wakeup.yml` can now declare its join.** It collects
  `sched.wakeup` and `sched.switches` side by side and correlates neither. The
  rule is three lines and belongs to whoever owns that file:

  ```yaml
  joins:
    - id: who-released-this
      from: sched.wakeup
      to: sched.switches
      via: task
      match: wakeup
      waker: waker_tid
      window: 1s
  ```

## Needs from another stream

Written down rather than fixed in passing, with the signature wanted.

### From stream A, in `src/encode.rs`: a correlation is not always a range

`correlation_text` renders every join as the allocation-fault one. It prints a
`heaviest ranges` heading, a `SIZE` column through `bytes(attribution.len)`, and
a closing paragraph explaining that the count is faults rather than bytes. Three
of the four matches have no extent, so `eq`, `scoped_eq` and `wakeup` all render
their attributions at `0 B` under a heading that calls them ranges, and a
wakeup chain is followed by a note about transparent huge pages.

`Attribution::key` already carries what each match means — `mem:[base,len)`,
`task:1234`, `blk:0xffff0000@99`, `task:99 -> task:100` — so what is wanted is
for the table to key off the match kind. `Correlation` does not carry it today;
it can, and the join thread will add it on request rather than guess the shape:

```rust
// in Correlation
pub match_kind: crate::catalog::MatchKind,
```

Say the word and it lands with the same defaults everything else has. It was not
added unasked because `Correlation` and `Attribution` are built as exhaustive
struct literals in `encode.rs`'s own tests, so a field added on this side breaks
the build on that one — which is also why `StateStats::replaced` could be added
(that literal uses `..Default::default()`) and nothing else could.

The same seam is why a `scoped_eq` run cannot yet report *why* a downstream
event went unattributed. "The pointer was reissued and this completion belongs
to the request before it" and "nothing ever opened that key" are different
facts, and only the second is a workload the reader can do anything about.

### From stream D, in `src/validate.rs`: refuse a malformed join before collecting

`check_joins` verifies that a rule's two sides are in the session and that both
carry the key. It cannot see the three ways a rule can fail against its own
match kind: an `interval` on a key that is not a range, a `scoped_eq` on a key
with no scope, and a `wakeup` that names no waker attribute or does not run on
`task`. All three are caught — but by the engine, which runs after the
measurement, so the cost of a malformed rule is the whole collection.

The engine exposes the check separately for this:

```rust
pub fn check(rule: &join::Rule) -> Result<(), join::JoinError>;
```

One call per rule in `check_joins`, pushing the error's own text as a
`Rejection`, and a session that cannot work is refused before anything attaches.
